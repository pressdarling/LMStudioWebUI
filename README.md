This works out of the box on Android devices. For iOS you need to open the file in Microsoft Edge or another browser. Safari/Chrome do not work. 
There are several ways to get the `index.html` file on your mobile device:

   - Download the `index.html` file on your computer.
   - Email it to yourself as an attachment.
   - Open the email on your mobile device and download the attachment.

3. **Cloud Storage**:
   - Upload the `index.html` file to a cloud storage service like Google Drive, Dropbox, or iCloud.
   - Access the file from your mobile device using the respective cloud storage app.

4. **File Transfer Apps**:
   - Use apps like AirDrop (for iOS devices) or nearby sharing (for Android devices) to transfer the file from your computer to your mobile device.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start LM Studio Server**:
   - Open LM Studio on your computer.
   - Go to the "Server" tab (In 0.3.x -> Developer -> Local Server).
   - Ensure that CORS is enabled and Serve on Local Network is enabled.
   - Click "Start Server" and note down the server address.

2. **Open the Chat Interface**:
   - On desktop: Double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser.
   - On mobile: Use a file manager app to locate the downloaded `index.html` file and open it with your web browser.

3. **Connect to LM Studio Server**:
   - In the chat interface, enter the LM Studio server address in the input field at the top. 
   - Click the "Connect" button.

4. **Start Chatting**:
   - Once connected, you can start typing messages in the input field at the bottom of the screen.
   - Press Enter or tap Send to send your message.
   - The model's responses will appear in the chat window.

## Troubleshooting

- **Can't connect to server**: 
  - Ensure LM Studio Server is running on your computer.
  - Check that you're using the correct server address.
  - If accessing from another device, make sure both devices are on the same network.

- **Slow responses**: 
  - LM Studio processing speed depends on your computer's capabilities. Larger models may take longer to respond.

- **Interface not loading**: 
  - Try opening the `index.html` file with a different web browser.

## Security Note

This interface is designed for local use only. Do not expose your LM Studio server to the public internet without proper security measures in place.
